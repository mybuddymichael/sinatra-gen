sinatra-gen
===========

**sinatra-gen** is a simple command-line utility to generate a starter [Sinatra]
project.

![sinatra-gen in zsh](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827486/sinatra-gen.png)

I noticed that I was constantly repeating the same steps to create new [Sinatra]
projects, so I created this to automate the task. It's very specific, but
contributions are welcome to improve and/or generalize functionality.

### To install, simply drop 'sinatra-gen' somewhere in your 'PATH'.

**sinatra-gen** is just a single-file bash script. It doesn't even require Ruby.
This means you can just drop it in your path and use it. It's fast and simple.

Tested with bash 3.2.48 and zsh 4.3.11.
