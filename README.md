sinatra-gen
===========

**sinatra-gen** is a simple command-line utility to generate a starter [Sinatra]
project.

I noticed that I was constantly repeating the same steps to create new [Sinatra]
projects, so I created this to automate the task. It's very specific, but
contributions are welcome to improve and/or generalize functionality.

### To install, simply drop 'sinatra-gen' somewhere in your 'PATH'.
